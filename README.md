# minesweeper
Classic re-design of Minesweeper in C.

Worked on as the final group project assignment for Introduction to C Programming course in the Fall of 2018. 
Utilizes high level elements such as recursive functions, 2D arrays, complex structs, pointers, and file I/O.
Keeps track of user's data for statistical analysis purposes and outputs it to a .txt file.
